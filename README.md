# pmode
Shell script for tiling WM xfce4-power-manager presentation mode indicator

# INFO
This script will use xfconf to determine the current state of presentation mode. There is no indicator for this on i3wm without a tray icon, so this will switch wallpapers for you to indicate the power mode state. "puffy" and "puffytest2" may be adjusted to your own needs.
